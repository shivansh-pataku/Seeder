it can be a 
idea just lingered in mind can be sure or unsure about idea rather trying to analyze the idea while writing so you have to first confirm its possibility
or 
academic or professional notes
or
a daily or once in all time experience or a self analysis
or
trying writing a poetry/story/lekh
or 
trying to write a blog or a post
or
a daily task
or
writing some kind or casual/professional document
or 
can be anything 

so
identify it first
most important is that you verify its correctness and authencity then proceed further 
and then

1. list of limitations 
2. suggestions for improvements
3. sources to refer to make it better, qualitative, more reliable, experienced from literature it belongs to.
vision : Current advancements and history on it. Provide the result appearing natural not like you are answering prompt.
