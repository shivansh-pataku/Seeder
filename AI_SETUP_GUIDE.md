```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

2. Add your Gemini API key to `.env.local`:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### In the Task Editor

1. **Create or edit a task** with at least 50 characters of content
2. **Select analysis type** from the dropdown:
   - Complete Analysis (recommended)
   - Find Limitations
   - Suggest Improvements  
   - Recommend Sources
3. **Click "Analyze Text"** to get AI-powered insights
4. **Review results** in the expandable results panel
5. **Use quick actions** to get focused analysis on specific aspects

### Best Practices

- **Write meaningful content** - The AI works best with substantial, coherent text
- **Be specific** - More detailed content leads to better analysis
- **Use different analysis types** - Each type provides unique insights
- **Review suggestions critically** - AI suggestions are helpful but not always perfect

## API Limits

The integration uses Google Gemini's free tier with generous limits:
- **15 requests per minute**
- **1500 requests per day**
- **No credit card required**

The system includes built-in rate limiting to prevent exceeding these limits.

## Error Handling

The system handles various scenarios gracefully:

- **No API key configured** - Shows configuration error
- **Rate limit exceeded** - Shows "service busy" message
- **Network issues** - Shows "try again later" message
- **Invalid content** - Shows specific validation errors

## Security

- **API key protection** - Key is stored securely on the server
- **Input validation** - All user input is validated before processing
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents abuse and protects your API quota
- **No data storage** - Text analysis is not stored or logged

## Troubleshooting

### "AI service not configured" Error
- Check that `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in your `.env.local` file
- Restart your development server after adding the key
- Verify the API key is valid at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com)

### "Service busy" Error
- You've exceeded the rate limit (15 requests/minute)
- Wait a moment and try again
- Consider using different analysis types for different content

### "Add more content" Error
- The text needs to be at least 50 characters long
- Add more meaningful content to your title and description

### Analysis Not Working
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify your API key is correctly set
3. Check your internet connection
4. Try with a smaller piece of text
